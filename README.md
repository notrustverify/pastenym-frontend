# Frontend - Pastenym

This project is inspired from [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) service.
The main goal is to offer a solution for sharing text with [Nym](https://nymtech.net/) products
to offer full anonymity, even on metadata level

### Demo
Get shared text: Get shared text: [https://pastenym.ch/#/jD6Vhmrz&key=b2d6ae002a1674daa43a07be7fc4f01c](https://pastenym.ch/#/jD6Vhmrz&key=b2d6ae002a1674daa43a07be7fc4f01c)


Share a text: [http://pastenym.ch/](http://pastenym.ch/)

## What Nym is developping ?
> Nym is developing the infrastructure to prevent this data leakage by protecting every packetâ€™s metadata at the network and application layers.

## How pastenym service will use Nym product
Your text is sent to a client which is connected to the Nym network and which stores it in a database (eventually a more distributed solution will be considered),



This system allows you to share information while respecting your privacy by protecting your data and metadata.

On the side of No Trust Verify we only see an anonymous id when sending the text, and therefore impossible to know who is behind and from where the data was sent. Moreover, data is end-to-end encrypted: your browser generates a key used to encrypt the text, the key is placed in the URL you share with your friends and is used in their browser to decrypt the text received by the server.


## Donate

If you enjoy pastenym, please consider buying us a cup of coffee. We worked hard to make it free and plan to spend alot of time supporting it. Donations are greatly appreciated.

## Init the project

### Frontend
NodeJS (`v18.2.0`) and NPM (`v9.20.0`) are used for the frontend.

1. Create a `.env` file with the same keys are in `.env.example` with your values. The `REACT_APP_NYM_CLIENT_SERVER` value should match the address displayed by the backend.
2. Run `npm install` and grab a cup of coffee
3. Run `npm run start` and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your favorite browser.

or

Run `npm run build` to build the project, everything will be in the `dist` folder. Just copy it to host it with a webserver


If you don't have a backend you can use this one, just set the `REACT_APP_NYM_CLIENT_SERVER=` to this value: `6y7sSj3dKp5AESnet1RQXEHmKkEx8Bv3RgwEJinGXv6J.FZfu6hNPi1hgQfu7crbXXUNLtr3qbKBWokjqSpBEeBMV@EBT8jTD8o4tKng2NXrrcrzVhJiBnKpT1bJy5CMeArt2w` 

### Host it publicly with Docker

If you want to host it publicly here's some steps that can help you

To run it:

1. Create a `.env` file with the following content
```
REACT_APP_NYM_CLIENT_SERVER=6y7sSj3dKp5AESnet1RQXEHmKkEx8Bv3RgwEJinGXv6J.FZfu6hNPi1hgQfu7crbXXUNLtr3qbKBWokjqSpBEeBMV@EBT8jTD8o4tKng2NXrrcrzVhJiBnKpT1bJy5CMeArt2w
SERVER_NAME="https://<FQDN>"
```
The `REACT_APP_NYM_CLIENT_SERVER` value should match the address displayed by the backend. You can use the one displayed up, it's a working backend

2. Copy and paste the content displayed [here](https://github.com/notrustverify/pastenym-frontend/main/README.md#docker-composeyml) in a `docker-compose.yml` file

3. set your hostname on this line (keep the ` `` `)
```
traefik.http.routers.pastenym-frontend.rule=Host(`YOUR HOSTNAME`)
```
5. start it `docker compose up --build -d`

##### Docker-compose.yml

```yaml
